<p>My hero is kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant was a professional basketball player in the NBA and played on
the Los Angeles Lakers. His 20-year career at the Los Angeles Lakers saw five NBA championships; the
2008 MVP award; a two-time NBA finals MVP; and Bryant was the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history.
Sadly, Kobe Bryant passed away recently due to a helicpoter crash on January 26, 2020.

<p>I chose Kobe Bryant as my hero because, he was a professional basketball player in the NBA and I
enjoy playing basketball. But more importantly, I chose him because of his work ethic, determination,
and discipline to achieve what he wanted in life. He motivates me to always want to achieve my goals 
and to continue to improve my discipline and work ethic.
