<p>My hero is kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant was a professional basketball player in the NBA and played on
the Los Angeles Lakers. His 20-year career at the Los Angeles Lakers saw five NBA championships; the
2008 MVP award; a two-time NBA finals MVP; and Bryant was the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history.
Sadly, Kobe Bryant passed away recently due to a helicpoter crash on January 26, 2020. One of his most
famous quotes is "Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise." - Kobe Bryant.

<p>One reason why I chose Kobe Bryant as my hero is partly because he was a professional basketball player in the NBA and I
enjoy playing basketball. But more importantly, I chose him because of his work ethic, determination,
and discipline to achieve what he wanted in life. Kobe Bryant would work 
in the gym constanly for multiple times day when he was younger because playing in the NBA was his 
dream and he wasn't going to let anyone stop him from achieving that goal. He motivates me to always 
want to achieve my goals and to continue to improve my discipline and work ethic.
